# Hello, World! I'm Michael - @Maxxxxz

I'm currently a CS Undergrad at Ohio University.

My favorite languages are Rust and Python.

Some of my interests outside of programming include: 
gaming and photography.

I think that with my abilities, I can help make software
that will make someone's life somewhere in the world just a little bit easier
