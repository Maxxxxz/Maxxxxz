# Hello, World! I'm Michael - @Maxxxxz

I'm an Ohio University alum having earned my B.S. in Computer Science in 2021.

I currently work at Ohio University as a Software Engineer.

I like to make things. So far, my favorite is my personal site, [michael-cooper.dev](https://michael-cooper.dev/).

I want to write software to help make the world a better place.
